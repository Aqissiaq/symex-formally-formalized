# symex-formally-formalized
Coq formalization of [Symbolic Execution Formally Explained](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00165-020-00527-y).

## Build
The included Makefile should allow just
```sh
make
```
To update the Makefile use
```sh
coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
```

## Table of Contents
### Formalization of de Boer et al.
 - [BasicConcrete](./BasicConcrete.v) formalizes section **2. Basic symbolic execution** for simple arithmetic and boolean expression with integer valuations.
    - Syntax and notation for expressions is in [Expr](./Expr.v)
    - Notation and lemmas about maps used for substitution and valuation are in [Maps](./Maps.v)
 - [Recursion](./Recursion.v) formalizes **3. Recursion** â€“ an extension of the basic language with procedure calls.
 - [OOP](./Oop.v) contains an incomplete formalization of **4. Object orientation.**

The approach to syntax and transition relation semantics is based on [Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html)

### Extensions
- [TraceSemantics](./TraceSemantics.v) introduces trace semantics for the language with procedures
  - Notation and lemmas about traces are in [Traces](./Traces.v)
- [ParallelTraces](./ParallelTraces.v) adds a parallel composition operator to the base language with trace semantics.
Additionally contains some preliminary results about reduction of trace sets.
- [ContextReduction](./ContextReduction) contains an alternative approach to syntax based on reductions in a context inspired by [Mechanized Semantics](https://github.com/xavierleroy/cdf-mech-sem)
